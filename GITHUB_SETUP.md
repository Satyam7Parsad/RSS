## 📤 Upload to GitHub (2 Options)

### Option 1: Automatic Upload (Recommended)

**I'll create the repository for you:**
Just create a new repository on GitHub and I'll push the code automatically.

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository with these settings:
   - Repository name: `rss-ecommerce-clothing-store`
   - Description: `Complete e-commerce website for RSS Clothing Brand`
   - Make it **Public** (so you can use GitHub Pages for free hosting)
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"
3. Come back here and tell me - I'll push the code!

### Option 2: Manual Upload

**Run these commands in Terminal:**

```bash
cd /Users/imaging/rss-ecommerce

# Create repository on GitHub (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
gh repo create rss-ecommerce-clothing-store --public --description "RSS E-commerce Clothing Store"

# Push code
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/rss-ecommerce-clothing-store.git
git push -u origin main
```
